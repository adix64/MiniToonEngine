This project has been in development from 2015 to 2017. Visual Studio is still in development and issues may arise while building.<br/>
MiniToonEngine has been tested with Visual Studio Community 2019, Platform Toolset v142 and Windows SDK 10.0.17763.0. <br/>
You can run GeneratePrj.bat and then upgrade the solution to the latest libraries.<br/>
After building, copy the missing .lib and .dll files in the executable directory, from the dependencies folder (e.g. SDL mixer)<br/>
Feel free to email me at adix64@gmail.com for any issues regarding the development of this project.
